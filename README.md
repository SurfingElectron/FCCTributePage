# README - Tribute Page

## 1.0

Used git and vscode to:

  * _pull_ the example repository to my local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with my own code (from CodePen) 

  * _changed_ the working to my own.

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to my repository.
